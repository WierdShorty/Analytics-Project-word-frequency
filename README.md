Word Frequency Word Frequency in Classic Novels
Utilize web scraping and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify the most common words in one of two
classic works: Herman Melville's Moby Dick or J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan.

Project Overview:
In this project, you'll scrape the full text of a novel from Project Gutenberg, a vast collection of literary works, using the Python requests package. Then, you'll extract the words from the scraped data with BeautifulSoup. Lastly, we'll analyze the frequency distribution of the words using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk). The NLP techniques applied here are valuable in many data science contexts, 
as much of the world's data is unstructured and contains large amounts of text.
